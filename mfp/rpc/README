mfp.rpc should wither away and die if I'm lucky. 

I started building it to make a useful layer of rpc-like behavior around
python multiprocessing.  I had to extend it numerous times to allow for
the bidirectional recursive RPC calls that cropped up in MFP usage.
Then finally extend it again to support plain C library interoperability 
for mfpdsp. 

Unfortunately I've by now reimplemented big pieces of several json-rpc 
packages.  One day I am going to refactor and use one of those.  One
day.
