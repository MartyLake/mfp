MFP compiled DSP extensions
--------------------------------------

The file extension_1.c represents the simplest possible C extension to
MFP.  It creates a new type of DSP object called ext1~ which does
nothing.  

To use the extension, you need to build a .so file.  The Makefile does that in a 
very simple way.  

    $ make

will build extension_1.so

To use the .so file, you need to point MFP to the extension at startup
time.  If you are running mfp from the top of the source tree,  

    $ mfp -L doc/extensions -l extension_1.so 

Should do it. 

This extension is doubly totally useless, because there's no Python
Processor subclass that uses it.  This extension just enables the
method Processor.dsp_init("ext1~", ...) to find the ext1~ DSP object
type.
