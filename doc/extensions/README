MFP compiled DSP extensions
--------------------------------------

The file extension_1.c represents the simplest possible C extension to
MFP.  It creates a new type of DSP object called ext1~ which does
nothing.  

To use the extension, you need to build a .so file.  The Makefile does that in a 
very simple way.  

    $ make

will build extension_1.so

To use the .so file, you need to point MFP to the extension at startup
time.  If you are running mfp from the top of the source tree,  

    $ mfp -L doc/extensions -l extension_1.so 

Should do it. 

This extension is doubly totally useless unless you also create a Processor 
subclass that knows to use that DSP class.  This exists in extension_1.py, which 
registers a new type [ext1~] which uses the "ext1~" DSP class.  To load it at runtime
as well, 

    $ mfp -L doc/extensions -l extension_1.so -p doc/extensions -f extension_1.py
