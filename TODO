Control processors: spigot, if

Signal processors: biquad~, hip~, lop~, phasor~, square~ 

GUI elements: button, toggle 

External elements: LADSPA hosts

Architectural issues: 
 * Signal-processing domain issues (can't route fft~ to dac~)
 * Structure of patches/abstractions 
  * Snapshots of all parameters 
  * "Macro" expansion of patches? 

Basics: 
 * isearch mode for element selection 
 * undo 
 * Selection management (multi select)
 * cut and paste 
 * pd-style save and load 
 * gtk accessorizing for gui window: menu, mode line, left click
 * Add a perf testing script 
 * error handling! 

Bugs: 
 * [route] allows changing number of outputs but nothing is propagated to the 
   GUI
 * Rebuilding [metro] to [metro 200] in gui doesn't set the time
