Control processors: trigger, spigot, if

Signal processors: biquad~, hip~, lop~, noise~, phasor~, square~ 

GUI elements: entry, slider, meter 

External elements: OSC, LADSPA hosts, MIDI i/o

Architectural issues: 
 * Gateways between signal and control (snapshot~)
 * Signal-processing domain issues (can't route fft~ to dac~)
 * Structure of patches/abstractions 
  * Snapshots of all parameters 
  * "Macro" expansion of patches? 
 * use SSE instructions where possible 
 * nonfloat parameters to DSP objects (line~) 

Basics: 
 * isearch mode for element selection 
 * osc~ should use cubic estimator
 * Selection management (multi select)
 * cut and paste 
 * Deleting objects and connections 
 * Driving creation from mfp master 
 * pd-style save and load 
 * gtk accessorizing for gui window: menu, mode line, left click
 * Add a perf testing script 
 * error handling! 

Bugs: 
 * [route] allows changing number of outputs but nothing is propagated to the 
   GUI
 * Rebuilding [metro] to [metro 200] in gui doesn't set the time 

Debug mode: 
 * every processor has a debug port on the side 
 * debug level gets set by message 
 * full backtraces should get dumped on error
